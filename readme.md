# Tanks Wars
An extension for Tanks: The Crusades that adds a variety of buildings to the tank selection, including but not limited to:
- Keeps (capturable fortresses that spawn defensive soldiers)
- Barracks (capturable buildings that spawn offensive soldiers)
- Sentries (turrets that shoot down any enemy tanks in their line of sight)

Additionally, there is a news feed that will show you the most recent happenings on the battlefield such as keeps captured and important tanks defeated.

The one caveat to this extension is that it is not supported on multiplayer. It has been tested and does not work.
The game server not properly telling clients what tanks are what type puts a frown on my face.
